        <h1>How to Buy MADDY Token</h1>
        <p>
          Purchasing MADDY tokens is straightforward, whether you are new to cryptocurrency or an experienced investor. 
          Follow the steps below to get started:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 1: Create a Wallet</strong> - If you are new to Solana and do not already have a Solana-compatible wallet, we recommend using 
            Phantom or OKX or Backpack. Download and set up your wallet, ensuring you securely store your recovery phrase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 2: Fund Your Wallet</strong> - Transfer SOL (Solana Native Token) to your wallet. You will need SOL 
            to purchase MADDY tokens and to pay for transaction fees.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 3: Connect Your Wallet</strong> - On the Meme for Maddy platform or on DEXScreener or Meteora, click Connect Wallet and select your wallet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 4: Purchase MADDY Tokens</strong> - Navigate to the token sale page and enter the amount of MADDY tokens 
            you wish to purchase. Confirm the transaction, and your MADDY tokens will be sent to your wallet.
          </li>
